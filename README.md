LED array and camera controlling for Fourier Ptychographic Topography / Reflection-mode Intensity Diffraction Tomography

# Abstract
Topography measurement is essential for surface characterization, semiconductormetrology, and inspection applications. To date, performing high-throughput and accuratetopography remains challenging due to the trade-off between field-of-view (FOV) and spatialresolution. Here we demonstrate a novel topography technique based on the reflection-mode Fourier ptychographic microscopy, termed Fourier ptychograhpic topography (FPT). We show that FPT provides both a wide FOV and high resolution, and achieves nanoscale height reconstructionaccuracy. Our FPT prototype is based on a custom-built computational microscope consisting of programmable brightfield and darkfield LED arrays.

This repo contains the controlling code for The Imaging Source (TIS) camera and the LED arrays.
