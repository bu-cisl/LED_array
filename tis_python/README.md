# TIS (the imaging source) camera controller
This python package is for TIS camera controlling on Windows,
and it interacts with the Arduino using serial communication.
It is a simple wrapper. Please see https://github.com/TheImagingSource/IC-Imaging-Control-Samples for reference.

In addition, you should put the `*.dll`, `tisgrabber.h`, `tisgrabber.py` files 
to the `tisgrabber` folder before running the script.
Please download the files from
